     *  \brief mono-vertex class structure (revoked)
     *
     *  This structure holds the definition and required elements to access mono
     *  vertex storage representation in door tree structure.
     *
     *  Three main elements are hold by the structure and its tree structure
     *  storage representation.
     *
     *  The first element is the color of the element injected in the tree
     *  structure. The color are three bytes hold in the first positions.
     *
     *  The next main element is the link to the daughter classes in the scale
     *  directly below the scale of the considered class. These links are simple
     *  offsets packed just after the color information.
     *
     *  The storage representation of one mono-vertex class can then be seen as
     *  follows :
     *
     *      [r][g][b][offset_0] ... [offset_7]
     *
     *  The color component are stored on one byte each while the amount of
     *  byte per offset is given by the \b _LE_USE_OFFSET constant.
     *
     *  The last main element of the structure is the color accumulation array
     *  and its corresponding size. As many point can be injected in the same
     *  class, a mean color has to be computed and assigned in the class storage
     *  representation. The \b mc_push array and \b mc_size counter are used
     *  during injection process to compute the mean color.
     *
     *  \var le_mono_struct::mc_size
     *  Mean color accumulation counter
     *  \var le_mono_struct::mc_push
